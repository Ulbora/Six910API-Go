### The Speeding Fast Shopping Cart
An open source ecommerce platform server for building online shopping cart systems; written in golang. This is the user's storefront and admin panel.

This project is intended to be the storefront UI that works with Six910 REST implementation of a hosted ecommerce solution. 

1. Users of Six910 UI, together with Six910 will be able to customize templates just like other hosted solutions.
2. Templates can either be written in Golang templating or use a JavaScript framework like Angular or React.
3. REST services will be used to expose all cart functionality.

## Template Designer
There will also be a template designer to make desiging templates much easier than it currently is with most hosted shopping cart solutions.

1. Users will be able to download there current template
2. Modify the template using the user's store URL
3. Upload the template back to the hosted site

**We need Golang developers to work on this project.** If you are interested in contributing, send a **pull request** with your name added to the developer section of the readme.
